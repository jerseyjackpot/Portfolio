## Story
This is the second draft of my professional coding portfolio. I utilized html and CSS with bootstrap grid style to layout my content. I originally had separate pages to containe an about me, showcase my coding projects, and a contact page for direct interaction with my page's audience. I have added a resume area, and animation from Anime.JS. 
Also, my updated nambar has an animated Hamburger Menu. The Contact function is still under construction

## Credits
